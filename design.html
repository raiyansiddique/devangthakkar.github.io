              <h1 class="title is-spaced is-size-3-desktop is-size-4-mobile">Design</h1>
              <p>I've been involved in design sporadically for a few years now, dipping my feet in the waters every now and then. Patterns interest me a lot - especially the role of randomness in generating visually appealing patterns. The other idea central to my design sense concerns the visualization of complex data. I believe that simplicity has its own place in visualization but a designer must not patronize the reader - they must not circumvent the inevitable complexity merely in order to cater to the hoi polloi. Below is a brief description of projects I've recently worked on. I'd be glad to chat about anything pertaining to design, mine or otherwise. Hit me up!</p>
              <h2 class="subtitle is-size-5-desktop"><a href="https://www.devangthakkar.com/design/nicerman">The Nicer Man Project</a> </h2>
              <p>Linux has a lot of commands, almost all of which come with a detailed manual page - or man page as it is often described. While the man page is the comprehensive documentation for the command, I've realized that it is often an overkill, especially for new coders who want to understand how the command works. This is the motivation behind The Nicer Man Project. This is a work in progress but you can still check out the project <a href="https://www.devangthakkar.com/design/nicerman">here</a>!</p>
              <h2 class="subtitle is-size-5-desktop"><a href="https://www.devangthakkar.com/design/36dot21">36 Days of Type 2021</a> </h2>
              <p>Created as part of <a href="https://www.36daysoftype.com/">36 Days of Type</a> 2021, this project was an attempt to learn to make animations using Processing. Processing is a really fun graphical library/IDE that allows us to convert mathematical equations into art. This was my first time experimenting with creating GIFs and I was pleasantly surprised with the result. You can check out the project <a href="https://www.devangthakkar.com/design/36dot21">here</a>!</p>
              <h2 class="subtitle is-size-5-desktop"><a href="https://www.devangthakkar.com/design/64dayproject">The 64 Day Project</a> </h2>
              <p>Created as part of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/the100dayproject/">#the100dayproject</a>, this project was intended to help me bring more routine in my life during this pandemic. I decided to dedicate this exercise to improving my command over handwritten-esque beziers and pastel palettes. The sequence of shapes is meant to remind me that a circle is, in the end, only a collection of infinitely small straight lines - a collection that needs to start with one straight line. You can check out the project <a href="https://www.devangthakkar.com/design/64dayproject">here</a>!</p>
              <h2 class="subtitle is-size-5-desktop"><a href="https://www.devangthakkar.com/design/azdrugs">A-Z of Mental Health Drugs</a> </h2>
              <p>Created as part of 36 Days of Type 2019, this project intends to make the conversation on mental health more commonplace in our quotidian conversations. Mental illnesses manifest themselves in a variety of forms, each one as unique as the person they affect. Identifying and understanding them is no facile task, and I wish to have this difficulty as the central motif connecting my artworks. Each of the 26 pieces corresponds to an alphabet - while some of them are easy to comprehend, some are more elusive. The illusive nature of these artworks is an allusive reference to the feelings often induced by these drugs. You can check out the project <a href="https://www.devangthakkar.com/design/azdrugs">here</a>!</p>
              <h2 class="subtitle is-size-5-desktop"><a href="https://www.devangthakkar.com/design/translate">Loss in Translation</a></h2>
              <p>A study on the non-invertibility of translation between languages, Loss in Translation analyzes how the top thousand nouns in English are translated to other languages and back. This is interesting because languages do not always have a one-to-one correspondence, meaning that (i) not every word in a given language may have a befitting analog in every other language, and (ii) some words in a language may be translated into multiple equally appropriate words in other languages. This project marks an important milestone in my personal journey as a designer - in fact, I would have been hesitant to call myself a designer before this.
